        <h3>You're on the signup page!</h3>

        <p>That means you may be interested in giving a talk. That's great!</p>

        <h4>So, how do you sign up?</h4>

        <strong>For now, copy/paste the below and email it to Jack at xjlin0@gmail.com</strong>. It not only says what topic on what day you're interested in but has a little agreement so that you know the ground rules for lecturing. <strong>Based on timestamps of email is how preference is treated</strong>. If two people want to do the same night, I'll ask the first signup if they'd like some help from the second. If they don't, the first person gets preference.

        Hi,
        <p>I would like to sign up to speak on <a>[DATE]</a>, about <a>[TOPIC]</a>.</p>
        <p>I understand that my talk will be about 20 minutes, and that I need to provide all questions no later than the night before the lecture so they can  be printed out and added to the site accordingly. If my lecture runs over about 25 minutes, I understand that I will be cut off.</p>
        <p>I understand that after lecture, I will "float" and assist others with questions they may have, as well as stay the whole time. In addition, I am responsible for all visual aids (slides, audio or visual).</p>

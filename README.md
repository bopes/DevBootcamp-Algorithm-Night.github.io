Wanna to know more about whiteboarding for the tech interview? Don't fight alone and feel frustrated, come to join us and discuss more, let's practice together.

## What is it?

A weekly workshop created to help DBC alumi/students practice their technical interview skills. The workshops are generally strucutred as follows:

**6:30-7:00:** Thunder talk on an algorithms topic.

**7:00-7:45:** Split up into groups of three. A new problem is displayed every 15 minutes. Each group member solves one problem while the other two group members act as interviewers.

**7:45-8:00:** Everyone gathers back together as a large group and discusses the questions.

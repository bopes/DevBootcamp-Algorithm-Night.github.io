**6:30-7:00:** Thunder talk on an algorithms topic.

**7:00-7:45:** Split up into groups of three. A new problem is displayed every 15 minutes. Each group member solves one problem while the other two group members act as interviewers.

**7:45-8:00:** Everyone gathers back together as a large group and discusses the questions.
